# RC_Car
This project is derived from my first robocar project.
It is a bluetooth remote-controlled car controlled via smartphone.
And via a button press, this car can switch to an automatic mode where it freely moves around and avoids obstacles using IR sensors.
You can press the button again to switch it back to manual mode.
